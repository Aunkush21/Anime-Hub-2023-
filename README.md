🌟 My First Project

A Reflection on My Starting Point in Web Development

This repository contains the very first project I ever created as a student exploring web development. Although it is simple, it represents an important milestone in my learning journey.

📘 About This Project

I built this project around two years ago, with limited knowledge and almost no experience. At that time, I was just starting to understand the basics of HTML, CSS, and design. This project helped me take my first steps into coding, and it played a major role in building my interest and confidence in development.

🎓 Why This Project Matters to Me

As a student, this project taught me more than just syntax or layout:

It showed me what it feels like to complete something on my own.

It helped me understand the value of patience and consistency.

It became the foundation for everything I have learned since then.

Even though it’s not perfect, it will always be special because it marks the beginning of my journey.

🚀 Why I Am Uploading It Now

I am sharing this project on GitHub to:

Document my growth as a student and developer

Preserve the earliest work I created

Remind myself how far I’ve come

Keep improving with every new project I build

I believe it’s important to acknowledge where we start, not just where we are now.

📂 Contents

This repository includes the original design files from my very first project.
The goal is not to show advanced features, but to display my starting point with honesty and pride.

🔍 Final Note

This project is simple, but meaningful. As I continue learning and building more advanced projects, I’ll always look back at this one as the moment where everything began
